# IPFS File Upload Feature

## What is IPFS?

IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) is a peer-to-peer distributed file system designed to connect all computing devices into a unified file system. It was developed by Protocol Labs and is a potential alternative to the traditional HTTP protocol.

Technically speaking, it is a distributed file system based on Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for content addressing, Git model for version management, Merkle object associations, peer-to-peer technology, global namespace IPNS, and various other technologies.

In simpler terms, you can think of it as a decentralized public cloud drive. As long as you know the path, you can access it directly.

## How to Use

#### Access the IPFS File Upload Tool: [www.cpbox.io/cn/ipfs](http://www.cpbox.io/cn/ipfs)

## IPFS Application Scenarios

* Distributed website hosting
* Blockchain data storage
* Large dataset sharing
* Content permanent archiving
* Decentralized application (DApps) development

Having said all that, for ordinary players like us, in what scenarios would IPFS be used?

NFT players are definitely the first to know. Because the images for minting NFTs must have data stored on-chain, some tools require you to provide the IPFS access path instead of uploading the image directly. At this time, we need to store the mint images on-chain first.

Secondly, as on-chain players, we can store some data we want to preserve in IPFS. This way, during access, it won't be like traditional centralized servers where if something goes wrong, the original path becomes inaccessible.
