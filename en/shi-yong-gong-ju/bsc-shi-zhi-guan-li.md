## Foreword

With the popularity of the BSC chain, more and more meme players are heading to Four.meme to launch coins. If you want to create a startup project, you will definitely need some related tools for substantial management. To address this issue, CPBOX has newly launched the Four.meme Market Cap Management Tool.

Considering that market cap manipulation itself involves transaction fee wear (charged by Four.meme), to avoid adding other additional fees, this feature is offered in the form of VIP monthly subscription. If you want to experience this tool, you can contact TG: @Aileen955 to get free usage!

Notes:

* For market cap management, all buy and sell operations are executed in wallet order sequentially. Users can sort by BNB balance above.
* Buy logic: Assuming 100 wallets each with 0.1 BNB. If pumping requires 1 BNB, it will buy out one wallet first and then the next, simulating natural growth of holding addresses.
* Sell logic: Assuming 100 wallets each with 0.1 BNB. If dumping sells 1 BNB, it will sell out one wallet first and then the next, simulating natural reduction of holding addresses. One-click dump means multiple wallets shipping simultaneously.

## Select Manipulation Token

* Enter the range for random buy amounts, minimum buy amount and maximum buy amount, e.g., 0.1～1BNB
* Select the maximum cumulative spend amount. If all wallet addresses have 10 BNB in pump chips, after selecting 50%, it will automatically stop the pump strategy when purchases exceed 5 BNB.
* Execute once: Indicates performing the buy strategy only once.
* Loop execute: After clicking, it will keep performing buy operations. Can be stopped manually.

* Enter the fixed buy amount, after selecting, each buy will be the same amount.
* Select the maximum cumulative spend amount. If all wallet addresses have 10 BNB in pump chips, after selecting 50%, it will automatically stop the pump strategy when purchases exceed 5 BNB.

### Slow Random Distribution

Select your manipulation token. If you want to distribute or wash away others' chips during the current time period, you can choose slow distribution.

Common scenarios:

* During the pump phase, if the market heat is high, choose to slowly sell off chips and exit.
* During the chip collection phase, if there are too many retail holders, pumping might be harvested by others, you can choose to distribute and wash chips, washing away the retails.
