# Overview

Aggregated Collection is an upgraded version of batch collection. This feature leverages the EIP-7702 protocol to help you transfer tokens from multiple wallets to a single designated wallet all at once. This feature currently supports BSC and Polygon. Other EVM-related public chains will be gradually opened in the future.

## Advantages of Aggregated Collection Compared to Traditional Collection

* **No need to store gas fees in wallets** - Only the main wallet needs to pay gas fees uniformly.

For users, if the token is not the native coin of a certain chain, you can skip the step of distributing gas tokens. This significantly reduces gas-related transaction costs. With traditional collection, after collecting tokens, you would also need to collect gas back to the original wallet.

* **Cleaner collection**

Because transfers typically require wallets to reserve extra gas fees to ensure transaction success, traditional collection cannot guarantee that all tokens in the wallet are completely emptied. This may leave some token residuals, causing waste. With aggregated collection, most tokens can be completely collected.

* **Faster collection speed**

No need to store gas fees in wallets - only the main wallet needs to pay gas fees uniformly.
