# Batch Send

### Feature Overview

CPBox's batch token sending tool allows you to send specified tokens from a single wallet to multiple wallet addresses in bulk. This feature supports custom nodes, custom gas fee settings, and flexible transfer interval control to improve your asset management efficiency. We support all EVM-compatible chains, and additionally support batch sending functionality for non-EVM chains such as [Solana](https://www.cpbox.io/en/solana/batch/send), [SUI](https://www.cpbox.io/en/sui/batch-send-token), [Tron](https://www.cpbox.io/en/tron/batch-send-token), Ton, Aptos, Cosmos, and more.

#### 3. Configure Send Amount

The system provides two amount setting modes:

**Fixed Amount Mode**

* Select the "Fixed Amount" option
* Enter the exact amount to send
* All receiving addresses will receive the same amount of tokens

**Random Amount Mode**

* Select the "Random Amount" option
* Set the send amount range:
  * Minimum amount: The smallest value allowed to send
  * Maximum amount: The largest value allowed to send
  * Decimal places setting: Control the precision of random amounts (e.g., setting "2" means keeping 2 decimal places)

#### 4. Advanced Settings

* Custom Node: Choose or add blockchain nodes according to your needs
* Gas Fee Settings: Adjust miner fees to optimize transaction speed and cost
* Send Interval: Set time intervals between each transaction to avoid network congestion

#### 5. Execute Batch Send

After completing all the above settings, click the "Start Execution" button to initiate the batch send process. The system will process all transactions sequentially according to your settings. After waiting a moment, the batch transfer will be completed, and all transfer information can be queried on-chain.

### Important Notes

* It's recommended to conduct small amount tests before executing large quantities of transactions
* Ensure the sending wallet has sufficient token balance and native tokens (for gas fees)
* After transaction completion, you can view detailed records in transaction history
* When transferring to exchange addresses, please confirm whether the exchange supports contract transfers, otherwise your transfer may not arrive
