# Derive Private Keys from Mnemonics

#### **Feature Overview**

Digital wallets typically use **mnemonic phrases** (a set of random words) as a seed to recover private keys. Based on standards like **BIP-32, BIP-39, and BIP-44**, these mnemonics can generate multiple cryptocurrency addresses. To help you recover wallet addresses, we provide a **mnemonic-to-private-key conversion** feature.

#### **Usage Steps**

1. **Log in to Your Account**
   * Open the **CPBox platform** and sign in.
2. **Access the Feature**
   * From the left-side menu, select **"Generate Private Key from Mnemonic."**
3. **Enter Information**
   * Input your **mnemonic phrase** (usually 12-24 words).
   * Set the **starting index** (default: 0).
   * Choose the correct **Path rule** (derivation path).
4. **Generate Private Key**
   * Click the **"Generate"** button.
   * The system will display the corresponding **private key and address.**

#### **Important Notes**

* **Always operate in a secure environment.**
* Different cryptocurrencies may require different **Path rules.**
* If you're unsure about **Path rules or starting index**, contact our **support team** for guidance.

#### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

❓ **What is a Path rule?**

* A **Path rule** refers to the derivation path defined in standards like BIP-44. Different cryptocurrencies may use different path formats.

❓ **Why do I need to set a starting index?**

* The **starting index** determines which position to begin generating addresses (usually starts at 0).
