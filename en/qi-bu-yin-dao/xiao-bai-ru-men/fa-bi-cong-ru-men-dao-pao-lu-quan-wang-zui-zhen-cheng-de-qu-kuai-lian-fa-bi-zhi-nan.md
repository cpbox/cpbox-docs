# The Complete Guide to Token Creation: From Launch to Exit

**Preface:**\
So you want to launch a token? Congrats! You've taken the first step toward becoming a "blockchain entrepreneur"—which is either:\
A) Revolutionizing finance, or\
B) Preparing to rug pull (let's be real, it's probably B).

But hold on! Token launches aren't just about copy-pasting an ERC-20 contract. Here’s your step-by-step guide from **"I have a genius idea"** to **"token price → zero"**—explained in plain English.

***

#### **Step 1: Pick a Chain – Which One Helps You Rug Best?**

You need a blockchain "home" for your masterpiece. Top contenders:

* **Ethereum (ETH):** The OG. Gas fees will make you weep, but it’s perfect for "prestige" scams.
* **Solana (SOL):** Launch tokens like tweets—fast and cheap. Just know your coin might die before lunch.
* **TON:** Telegram’s golden child. Built-in traffic, but you might get flagged as a shitcoin.
* **BSC:** The rug-puller’s paradise. Low cost, but your project will instantly smell like a honeypot.

**Pro Tip:** If gas fees scare you, just announce your token on Twitter. (Spoiler: No one will care.)

#### **Step 2: Token Contract – The Ctrl+C & Ctrl+V Masterpiece**

Let’s face it—**50% of token devs** (and that’s being generous) just:

1. Search GitHub for **"free ERC-20 contract"**
2. Replace **"ExampleToken"** with **"ScamCoin2024"**
3. Click **"Deploy"**

**Common Disasters:**

* Forgetting to adjust **total supply**, accidentally minting **1 quadrillion tokens**.
* Not locking liquidity, so bots drain your pool in seconds.
* Leaving backdoors… only for hackers to rug **you** first.

**Real Advice:** If you can’t read code, just use **CPBox’s token launch tool**—it’s idiot-proof (and cheaper than a hack).

#### **Step 3: Liquidity – No Pool, No Fools**

A token without liquidity is like a **dry swimming pool**—people jump in and break their necks.

**Classic Moves:**

1. Add **10 ETH** to create a tiny LP pool.
2. Shill **"Community-driven liquidity!"** on Twitter.
3. Pull the pool **once suckers ape in**.

**Honest Suggestion:** If you can’t afford liquidity, just **mint an NFT** instead. (Way cheaper to rug.)

#### **Step 4: Marketing – How to Attract Willing Bagholders**

Even the best scams need hype. **Low-budget strategies:**

* **Twitter/X:** Spam **"LFG!"** and tag random KOLs (who’ll ignore you).
* **Telegram:** Fill a group with bots screaming **"MOON SOON!"**
* **Discord:** Run a fake airdrop (400/500 wallets are yours).

**Premium Scam Tactics:**

* Pay a **KOL with 3 real followers** to shill your coin.
* Photoshop **"whale buy" screenshots** (just remove the watermark).
* Fake a **"partnership"** (aka your alt accounts liking each other’s tweets).

***

#### **Step 5: Post-Launch – The Art of the Rug (or the Slow Fade)**

The real skill lies in **what happens after launch**:

* **If price pumps?** Write a manifesto: **"True value recognized!"**
* **If price dumps?** Blame **"market FUD"** and promise **"big news soon."**
* **If no one buys?** Wash trade with your own wallets.

**Golden Rules of Rugging:**\
✅ **Don’t get greedy** – Exit before the mob does.\
✅ **Don’t get cocky** – SEC letters aren’t trophies.\
✅ **Don’t get stupid** – Leave a **plausible deniability trail**.

***

#### **Final Words**

See? Launching a token isn’t hard. The **real challenge? Cashing out before $0.**

So go forth, future **"blockchain innovator"**! Remember:\
&#xNAN;_"Launch early = visionary. Launch late = copycat. Don’t launch = loser."_\
—Some Crypto Guru (Probably)

**May your token:**\
📈 Pump at launch\
💰 Let you exit\
🕳️ Rug gracefully (jk… unless?)

_(Disclaimer: This is satire. Don’t actually rug. Or do. We’re not your mom.)_
