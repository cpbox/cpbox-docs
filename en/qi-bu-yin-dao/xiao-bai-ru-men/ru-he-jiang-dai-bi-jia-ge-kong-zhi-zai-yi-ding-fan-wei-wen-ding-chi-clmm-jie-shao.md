# Price Control Strategies: A Guide to Stable Pool CLMM

### Preface

Many projects have specific needs, such as stabilizing their token price within a certain range, but they may not know how to achieve this. Today, we’ll explain how to control a token’s price within a desired range.

Some might say, _“Isn’t creating a stable pool with CLMM enough?”_ — but this is a misunderstanding.

First, let’s clarify the pricing mechanism and adjustment principles of **CLMM (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker)**:

#### Core Features of CLMM

CLMM allows liquidity providers (LPs) to concentrate their funds within a **custom price range** (instead of providing liquidity across all price ranges). This means:

* When the market price is within your set range, your liquidity is utilized, and you earn trading fees.
* When the market price moves outside your range, your liquidity becomes **“inactive”** (no longer participating in trades).

#### Price Limits and Adjustment Mechanisms

**(1) Prices Are Not Automatically Fixed Within a Range**

&#x20;**Misconception**: CLMM does **not** forcibly restrict prices to a fixed range.\
&#x20;**Correct Understanding**: Prices are still determined by market supply and demand. CLMM simply lets LPs choose **where** to provide liquidity.

**(2) Behavior When Prices Deviate**

When the market price exceeds an LP’s set range:

* That LP’s liquidity **stops** participating in trades.
* Other LPs (whose ranges include the new price) continue providing liquidity.
* The inactive liquidity **converts to a single asset** (e.g., if the price rises above your upper limit, your funds become entirely the quote token).

Of course, all of the above applies to **LPs (Liquidity Providers)**. The essence of CLMM is to **reduce LP losses** under certain conditions.

However, for project teams, the token price is **not truly fixed** within a range. If large buy/sell orders occur and the price enters a zone with **no liquidity**, the price can still fluctuate—it just won’t execute trades.

### Solution

To stabilize a token’s price within a range on a blockchain (e.g., Solana), **active market intervention** is typically required, usually via **algorithmic trading bots** (arbitrage/market-making bots). The exact approach depends on your goals (full price stability vs. guiding price trends) and resources (capital, technical capabilities). Below are detailed solutions:

#### 1. Relying on CLMM Liquidity Design

* **Provide deep liquidity within the target price range** (e.g., 1.0 USDC – 1.2 USDC) in CLMM pools (e.g., Orca Whirlpools or Raydium CLMM).
* **Effect**:
  * When the price deviates, liquidity decreases, and slippage spikes, naturally discouraging large trades.
  * However, it **cannot fully prevent price breaks** (requires active intervention).
* **Drawback**:
  * Over-reliance on pool depth—if liquidity is insufficient, large orders may fail or cause significant price gaps.

#### 2. Algorithmic Trading Bot Control

For stricter price control, an automated trading bot is needed. Common strategies include:

**(1) Simple Limit Order Bot**

**Logic**:

* If **price > upper limit (e.g., 1.2 USDC)**, the bot **sells** tokens (increasing supply).
* If **price < lower limit (e.g., 1.0 USDC)**, the bot **buys** tokens (reducing supply).

**Pseudocode Example**:

```javascript
while (true) {
const currentPrice = fetchPriceFromDEX(); // 从DEX获取当前价格
if (currentPrice > TARGET_MAX) {
    sellToken(amountToSell); // 卖出代币，压低价格
 } else if (currentPrice < TARGET_MIN) {
    buyToken(amountToBuy); // 买入代币，推高价格}sleep(10_000); // 每10秒检查一次
 }
 sleep(10_000); // 每10秒检查一次
}
```

**Best for**: Mid-to-small-cap tokens with sufficient capital.

**(2) Dynamic Market Making (DMM)**

**Logic**:

* Acts like a traditional market maker, placing limit orders to earn fees while stabilizing price.
* Uses **TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)** or **VWAP (Volume-Weighted)** for smoother adjustments.\
  **Advantage**:
* Reduces market impact compared to simple limit orders.\
  **Tools**:
* Bonfida or Serum API (Solana).

#### 3. Hybrid Approach: CLMM + Bot Coordination

* **CLMM provides baseline liquidity** (deep liquidity in the target range, e.g., 1.0–1.2 USDC).
*   **Bot handles edge cases**:

    * **Buys near the lower bound (1.0 USDC)** for support.
    * **Sells near the upper bound (1.2 USDC)** for resistance.





**Example Architecture:**

```javascript
Price Monitoring Service (e.g., Pyth Network)
       ↓
Trading Bot (判断是否干预)
       ↓
Execute Trade (Jupiter API / Orca SDK)
       ↓
Update CLMM Liquidity (如果需要调整区间)
```

***

### Summary

* **CLMM liquidity management helps stabilize prices but cannot enforce hard limits.**
* **Algorithmic bots are essential for active control**, combining limit orders, dynamic market-making, and arbitrage.
* **Best Practice = Deep CLMM Liquidity + Bot Boundary Intervention**
