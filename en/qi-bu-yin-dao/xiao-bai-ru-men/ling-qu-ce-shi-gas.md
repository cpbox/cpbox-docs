# **Claim Test Tokens on Different Blockchains**

In blockchain development, the testnet is an important environment for developers to debug smart contracts, simulate transactions, and verify DApp functionality. However, gas fees (transaction fees) on testnets still require test tokens to pay, and obtaining these tokens usually involves applying from a **faucet**.

When developing web3 applications, one common frustration is not knowing where to claim test tokens.

To make it easier for everyone to get test tokens, we have compiled a list of faucet links:
