# Vanity Address Generation

### Feature Overview

Vanity wallet addresses (also known as Vanity Addresses) are blockchain addresses with personalized character combinations that make your wallet address more recognizable and distinctive. The CPBox platform now supports vanity address generation for multiple mainstream blockchains, including EVM-compatible chains (such as Ethereum, BSC, Polygon), Solana, and Tron.

### What are Vanity Wallet Addresses?

Vanity wallet addresses are blockchain addresses that contain specific custom characters, such as addresses that start or end with your name, favorite words, or numbers. These addresses function exactly the same as regular wallet addresses but are more personalized and recognizable.

### Using CPBox to Generate Vanity Wallet Addresses

#### Step 1: Log in to CPBox Platform (https://www.cpbox.io)

1. Open the CPBox website and log in to your account
2. Find and click the "Utility Tools" option in the homepage navigation
3. Select "[Vanity Wallet Address Generator](https://www.cpbox.io/cn/vanity-address)" from the tools list

#### Step 2: Select Blockchain Network

Choose the blockchain network for which you want to generate a vanity address:

* EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, etc.)
* Solana
* Tron
* Other supported blockchains

#### Step 3: Customize Your Vanity Address

CPBox provides three customization methods:

1. **Custom Prefix**:
   * Enter your desired characters in the "Prefix" input box
   * Example: Entering "ABC" will generate an EVM address starting with 0xABC...
2. **Custom Suffix**:
   * Enter your desired characters in the "Suffix" input box
   * Example: Entering "888" will generate an address ending with ...888
3. **Custom Prefix and Suffix**:
   * Set both prefix and suffix for the address
   * Example: Prefix "LUCKY" and suffix "777"

#### Step 4: Set Address Generation Parameters

1. Select character case sensitivity (case-sensitive/case-insensitive)
2. Set matching difficulty (more characters = longer generation time)
3. Adjust computational resource allocation (affects generation speed)

#### Step 5: Generate and Save Your Vanity Address

1. Click the "Start Generation" button
2. The system will begin calculating and searching for addresses that meet your requirements
3. Upon successful generation, you will see:
   * Public key (your vanity address)
   * Private key (must be stored securely)
   * Mnemonic phrase (if applicable)

### Security Tips

1. **Private key security is crucial**: After generating a vanity address, please store the private key and mnemonic phrase securely in an offline environment
2. **Use secure connections**: Ensure you use a secure network connection when generating addresses
3. **Verify addresses**: Use blockchain explorers to verify that your vanity address is working correctly

### Advanced Tips

1. **Balance difficulty and time**: More characters and special patterns require longer generation times
2. **Use combinations of numbers and letters**: Enhance address uniqueness
3. **Consider chain characteristics**: Different blockchains have different address formats, character selection should consider the chain's characteristics

### Frequently Asked Questions
