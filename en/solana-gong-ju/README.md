# Solana Tools

This article covers multiple batch tools and token creation tool tutorials for the Sol chain.

If you haven't issued tokens before, you can first read this article:

**What should you do after issuing tokens?**

Issuing tokens on Solana is like opening a bubble tea shop - low barriers to entry, but fierce competition. You either need real skills (like smart contract development and operations expertise), or financial power (like being willing to invest heavily in liquidity). Don't go "all-in" from the start, or you might end up with tokens issued, wallet empty, community fled, leaving you talking to yourself in the Telegram group. If you're ready and want to make a big splash issuing tokens on the Sol chain, let me explain the three key moves for token issuance:

* Create the token
* Add liquidity
* DEX trading

If you can't code and want to issue tokens on the SOL chain, you can refer to this article:

If you don't know how to add liquidity, you can refer to this article:

Of course, aside from this approach, the Sol chain has another option - pump.fun can also be used for token issuance. When the bonding curve reaches the requirement, it can also launch successfully.

**Pump Launch? First ask yourself if you can run faster than the retail investors**

You see others making 10x, 100x on Pump.fm and feel tempted? Don't forget that sniping bots on Solana are more numerous than wild dogs. Your token might be devoured by scientists before retail investors even enter the market after hitting DEX. Either you have the skills to counter-snipe, or you prepare enough liquidity, otherwise it might be "launch is the peak, then straight south."

Of course, if you use **CPBox's pump launch bundled buy feature**, the above problems won't be major issues. CPBox is designed to help friends who can't code, allowing you to be in a relatively fair position through our tools.

If you don't know how to use the pump launch bundled buy feature, you can refer to this article:

**Community Operations? Don't just create groups, learn to 'paint the vision'**

Creating a TG group and posting a few "Moon" and "To the Mars" emojis - anyone can do that. The key is making retail investors (oh no, "community members") believe your project truly has a future. Even if you're currently a "three-nothing product" (no product, no team, no roadmap), you at least need to learn to tell stories, like: "We're in talks with a mysterious institution" or "A major exchange listing next week" (even though you don't know which one yourself).

Of course, just painting visions isn't enough. You also need to occasionally send token airdrops to your community. If you don't know how to **send airdrops** to lucky users in your community, you can refer to this article:
