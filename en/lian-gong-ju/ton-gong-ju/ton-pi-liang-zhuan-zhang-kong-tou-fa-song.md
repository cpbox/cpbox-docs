# TON Bulk Transfers & Airdrops

### Feature Overview <a href="#gong-neng-gai-shu" id="gong-neng-gai-shu"></a>

CPBox's bulk token sending tool allows you to send specified tokens from a single wallet to multiple wallet addresses in bulk. This feature supports custom nodes, custom gas fee settings, and flexible transfer interval control, improving your asset management efficiency. We support all EVM-compatible chains, and additionally, we support bulk sending functionality for non-EVM chains such as [Solana](https://www.cpbox.io/en/solana/batch/send?_s=docs), [SUI](https://www.cpbox.io/en/sui/batch-send-token?_s=docs), [Tron](https://www.cpbox.io/en/tron/batch-send-token?_s=docs), Ton, Aptos, Cosmos, and more.

This article provides a detailed explanation of how to bulk send Token coins on the TON chain.

**Target Users:**
* On-chain players, airdrop farmers: Need to use multiple wallet accounts for on-chain interactions or to meet airdrop project requirements
* Community operation managers: Need to send token airdrops or community event rewards.

After connecting your wallet, set the sending network to TON and configure the receiving wallets. You can add receiving wallet addresses in the following two ways:

* Manual input: Directly enter wallet addresses in the text box
* Batch import: Click the "Import File" button to upload a file containing multiple wallet addresses

After entering wallet addresses, click "Modify Amount"

**Note: You must click "Modify Amount"**, otherwise the default sending amount will be 0. Select fixed amount, then click send to successfully complete the transfer.

First, let's go to Tonviewer to find the contract address (CA) of the Token you want to send.

Copy the CA address and paste it into the token contract address text box on the page.
