# Create Tokens with One Click

### Introduction

Over the past year, the TON token has demonstrated an impressive performance, skyrocketing from around $2.5 at the beginning of the year to nearly $8 at its peak, thanks in large part to its backing by the Telegram app, which provided a natural advantage in user adoption. However, due to market adjustments and issues surrounding Telegram's founder, the token's performance has recently weakened.

**Deep Integration with Telegram**: TON is tightly integrated with Telegram, allowing users to conduct on-chain transactions directly through Telegram wallet bots (e.g., @wallet), significantly lowering the barrier to entry.\
**Multiple Smart Contract Languages**: Supports FunC (TON's native language), Tact (a simplified smart contract language), and Solidity (via an EVM-compatible layer), catering to diverse developer needs.\
**TON Foundation Support**: The TON Foundation continuously funds high-quality ecosystem projects, driving developer growth.

These strengths have been instrumental in sustaining the ecosystem's expansion.

This article will guide you on how to use **CPBox** to issue a token on the TON blockchain with just one click.
